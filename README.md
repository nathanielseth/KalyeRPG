# KalyeRPG

KalyeRPG is an in-progress school project developed using Java Swing. It is a satirical game inspired by the Pok√©mon series, but with a unique twist taking  place in the lively environment of the "kalye" (philippine street). The project aims to provide a fun and entertaining experience by combining elements of RPG gameplay with humorous and sarcastic content.

## Features

**PokeKalyes**: The game features over 30 different pokekalyes (street animals). Each of them has its own moveset and HP stats, making them distinct from one another.

**Original Soundtrack**: The game's original soundtracks are composed by [andresntlcs](https://github.com/andresntlcs).  Additionally, the game also uses royalty-free sound effects.

**Gameplay**: A turn-based challenging and arcade-y gameplay, requiring optimal runs to complete the game.

## Game Design
KalyeRPG serves as both a school project and a personal endeavor. Although the game is developed using Java Swing, a framework primarily used for building desktop applications, it was chosen as the development framework by the University.

The gameplay of KalyeRPG, although simple in concept, is intentionally designed to be challenging, requiring players to strategize and make optimal decisions to progress. Although luck plays a significant role, skill and strategic thinking are key factors for reaching the end. The game does not feature savestates, and if the player character is defeated, it results in a game over.

## Download
Once the game reaches a releasable state, a download link will be provided.
