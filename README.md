# KalyeRPG

KalyeRPG is a Java Swing GUI game inspired by the Pok√©mon series, but with a unique twist- taking  place in the lively environment of the "kalye" (philippine street). The project is developed in compliance with the requirements of my college programming class.

## Key Highlights

**PokeKalyes**: The game features over 40 different pokekalyes (street animals). 

**Original Soundtrack**: The game's original soundtracks are composed by [andresntlcs](https://github.com/andresntlcs) and myself.

**Gameplay**: A simple turn-based challenging and arcade-y gameplay, requiring strategy to complete the game.

## Game Design

The gameplay of KalyeRPG, although simple in concept, is intentionally designed to be challenging, requiring players to strategize and make optimal decisions to progress. Although RNG plays a significant role, skill and strategic thinking are key factors for reaching the end. The game does not feature savestates, and if the player character is defeated, it results in a game over.

### Features
- Search: Engage in random encounters with enemies based on your level and the area you are in.
- Areas: Switch to various locations with distinct enemy pools and different shops. Unlock new areas as you progress through the game.
